# Camp MODA

**Role:** Visual Designer | **Timeline:** 2023  
**Project Type:** Speculative Rebrand

---

## Overview

Camp MODA is the Museum of Design Atlanta’s summer program for ages 6 - 18. This speculative rebrand creates a flexible identity system that energizes kids and teens across digital and physical platforms.

## Challenge

The original branding felt too static for kids and too generic for teens. MODA needed a system that could attract attention in all environments, span a wide age range, and reflect the camp’s creative, tech-forward mission.

## Solution

I created a brand system built on two key pillars:

**Familiarity** - Inspired by games like Minecraft and Super Mario, I used modular, pixel-style letterforms and bold primary colors to create a playful, approachable look.

**Innovation** - To reflect MODA’s focus on modern design and technology, I introduced a 3D voxel-based aesthetic. This added depth, movement, and dimension, pushing the visual language into a space that felt digital-native, current, and immersive.

## Logo System & Color Variations

To ensure flexibility across formats and age groups, I designed a full suite of logo variations. These included a vibrant, multi-block primary logo, high-contrast mono and duotone options for print and apparel, and staggered layouts inspired by retro games. The system keeps the brand playful, recognizable, and adaptable across digital, print, and motion.

## 3D Wordmark & MODA Monsters

The 3D wordmark reimagines Camp MODA with a voxel-inspired type system built from modular pixel blocks. Bold colors, dynamic lighting, and a tilted layout evoke retro games while capturing the creative energy of summer camp.

The MODA Monsters are voxel-style mascots designed to reflect that same spirit. With glowing edges and expressive forms, they add playful personality and nostalgic charm across digital, print, and motion.

This visual language came to life in a branded poster, combining the 3D branding, MODA Monsters, and STEM-inspired icons to connect with all age groups. I also extended the identity to branded t-shirts.

## Outcome

Although this was a speculative proposal, the final identity successfully repositioned Camp MODA as vibrant, tech-forward, and age-inclusive. The system captured the camp’s playful spirit while maintaining structure and flexibility across platforms.
