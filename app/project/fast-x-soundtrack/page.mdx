# Fast X Soundtrack

**Role:** Visual Designer | **Timeline:** 2023  
**Client:** Artist Partner Group (APG) / Universal Pictures

## Overview

Visuals for Spotify Canvas, Apple Music, YouTube, and social media, balancing cinematic energy with platform-specific adaptability.

## Challenge

The Fast X soundtrack needed a bold visual identity that matched the franchise’s cinematic intensity while introducing a fresh, engaging look across platforms. The creative direction had to resonate with long-time fans and new listeners, ensuring consistency across cover art, motion content, and promotional rollouts under tight deadlines.

## Solution

Artist Partner Group brought me on to help create the visual system for Fast X soundtrack visuals. I collaborated closely with the SVP of Marketing to design cohesive static and motion visuals for Spotify Canvas, Apple Music, YouTube, and social media, balancing cinematic energy with platform-specific adaptability.

## Branded Cover Art System

As part of the visual rollout for the soundtrack, I created a series of branded cover artworks for key singles. Each design followed a unified grid and layout system, while allowing flexibility in typography, material textures, and lighting to match the tone of each track and artist lineup. I also produced motion versions for each cover. This system allowed the soundtrack to feel cohesive yet dynamic, reinforcing the identity of Fast X while giving each release its own distinct visual impact.

## Album Cover Animation

While I did not design the official Fast X album cover artwork, I was responsible for animating it for digital rollout. The animation was adapted for Apple Music, Spotify, YouTube, and other social media platforms.

## Outcome

The final visuals launched with the Fast X soundtrack, boosting engagement and reinforcing the film’s brand. Animated assets increased shareability, while the cohesive design system elevated the soundtrack’s standalone presence, contributing to over 50 million streams.
