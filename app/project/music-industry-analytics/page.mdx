# Music Industry Analytics Dashboard

**Role:** Business Intelligence & Data Analyst | **Timeline:** July 2025 - Aug 2025  
**Tech Stack:** Python, SQLite, Power BI, DAX

---

## Overview

A comprehensive analytics system designed to transform fragmented Billboard chart data into actionable strategic intelligence. By consolidating streams, airplay, and sales into a unified view, this dashboard empowers music executives to make evidence-based promotional decisions.

## The Challenge

Music industry decision-making is hindered by data fragmentation.
*   **Siloed Data:** Streaming, airplay, and sales data exist in separate reporting streams, making cross-channel analysis difficult.
*   **Lack of Context:** Traditional rankings show *who* is #1 but not *why* (e.g., is it radio-driven or viral streaming?).
*   **Manual Effort:** Analysts spend hours manually correlating weekly charts in spreadsheets.

## The Solution

I built a full-stack analytics pipeline that automates data ingestion and delivers interactive insights.

### System Architecture

1.  **Data Engineering (Python/SQLite):**
    *   Developed automated ETL pipelines to ingest weekly chart data.
    *   Implemented intelligent parsing algorithms to handle complex artist collaboration strings (e.g., "feat.", "x").
    *   Designed a normalized database schema to track artist-song relationships over time.

2.  **Visualization (Power BI/DAX):**
    *   Created 50+ custom DAX measures for dynamic time-series analysis.
    *   Built interactive views comparing Streaming vs. Airplay performance.

## Impact & Results

*   **Strategic Clarity:** Enabled executives to identify platform-specific performance gaps (e.g., high streaming but low radio).
*   **Operational Efficiency:** Eliminated manual weekly data entry, saving hours of analyst time per week.
*   **Unified Truth:** Created a single source of truth for cross-platform performance metrics.
