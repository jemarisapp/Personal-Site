# Navigate IDD - Medicaid Waiver Education System

An AI-assisted, policy-grounded education system that transforms Medicaid waiver regulations into multilingual videos with verified accuracy and human oversight. Built to simplify complex disability services information for families, while maintaining compliance, traceability, governed AI practices, and trust.

## My Role

Led technical architecture and automation development for a four-person team. Designed and implemented the RAG policy retrieval layer, multi-agent AI pipelines, and human review controls. Built end-to-end workflows for script generation, translation, video production, and social publishing. Ensured scalability, auditability, and alignment with regulated environment requirements to support policy validation workflows.

## The Problem

Families seeking disability services face dense rules, long waitlists, and confusing waiver language. Learning the system often takes weeks, and multilingual guidance is rare. Traditional solutions rely on manual translation, manual video creation, and slow updates when rules change.

This slows access to care, increases administrative burden, and leaves underserved communities behind.

## Solution Overview

Navigate IDD is a governed AI system that turns verified Medicaid waiver policy into plain-language videos across multiple languages. The system uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), agent workflows, and human review controls to ensure accuracy, compliance, and accessibility.

This enables reliable guidance at scale while preserving trust and accountability in a regulated domain.

## System Architecture Overview

Core pipelines powering policy retrieval, multilingual script generation, review workflows, and automated video publishing.

### Content Generation Pipeline

**Pinecone Vector Store Management**
*   **Data Source Monitor:** Triggers when new source documents are added.
*   **Vector Processing:** Embeds and stores source documents for retrieval.
*   **Knowledge Base:** Maintains up-to-date waiver information for AI reference.

### Retrieval Augmented Script Generation

*   **Short Topic Workflow:** Creates 1-1.5 minute educational videos.
*   **Long Topic Workflow:** Creates 4-5 minute comprehensive videos.
*   **Data Sources:** Monitors Google Drive for new topic files.
*   **AI Processing:** Uses GPT-4 models with Pinecone vector store for RAG.
*   **Output:** Structured scripts ready for human review.

### Document Creation & Approval

**English Document Creation**
*   **Google Docs Integration:** Creates formatted documents from generated scripts.
*   **Dashboard Updates:** Tracks script status in Google Sheets.
*   **Approval Workflow:** Routes scripts for human review and approval.

### AI Script Translation

*   **Multi-language Support:** Translates approved scripts into Spanish, Chinese, and other languages.
*   **Cultural Adaptation:** Maintains appropriate tone and terminology for target languages.
*   **Quality Control:** Ensures translations meet accessibility standards.

### Video Production & Processing

**AI Video Generation**
*   **Multi-language Video Creation:** Generates videos in English, Chinese, and Spanish.
*   **Avatar Selection:** Uses different avatars for different languages.
*   **Background Customization:** Applies appropriate backgrounds for each content type.
*   **Status Tracking:** Monitors video generation progress.

**Video Processing Pipeline**
*   **Status Monitoring:** Checks video completion status via Synthesia API.
*   **Download Management:** Automatically downloads completed videos.
*   **Google Drive Storage:** Saves videos with organized naming conventions.
*   **Completion Tracking:** Updates status in Google Sheets.

### Distribution & Publishing

**YouTube Upload & Management**
*   **Automated Upload:** Uploads videos to YouTube with proper metadata.
*   **SEO Optimization:** Generates titles, descriptions, and tags using AI.
*   **Metadata Management:** Updates video information for discoverability.
*   **Completion Tracking:** Marks uploads as complete in tracking systems.

## Workflow Walkthrough

1.  **Upload Verified Waiver Documents**
    Agencies upload official Medicaid waiver files. Policy language is stored as a structured data source to ensure all content remains grounded in verified regulations.

2.  **Build Policy Knowledge Layer**
    Documents are embedded and indexed in Pinecone as a vector database. This creates a searchable policy memory, preventing hallucination and ensuring traceability.

3.  **Define Topics for Education**
    Short topic files trigger content generation for specific waiver sections. This gives program managers control over curriculum and rollout priorities.

4.  **Script Generation with RAG**
    AI retrieves relevant policy text and drafts clear, structured scripts based on verified rules. Every script references source material and prepares for human review.

5.  **Human Review and Approval**
    Scripts appear in a dashboard for evaluation. Reviewers validate accuracy, tone, and clarity. Approved scripts advance for localization and production while revisions loop back into review.

6.  **Multilingual Content Pipeline**
    When a script is approved, users select languages. The system regenerates each script using the same verified policy layer to preserve meaning beyond literal translation.

7.  **AI Video Production**
    Approved scripts are converted into video explainers using Synthesia. Generated videos return to the dashboard for verification before public release. This maintains a full governance loop from regulation to final output.

8.  **Distribution and Accessibility**
    Agent workflows generate captions, titles, and metadata, then prepare videos for distribution across YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook.

    Human validation remains in place before content goes live. The result is accurate, accessible policy education delivered where families already learn.

## Monitoring & Maintenance
