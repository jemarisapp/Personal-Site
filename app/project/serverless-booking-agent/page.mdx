# The Serverless Booking Agent: 4 Hours to 20 Seconds

**Role:** Technical Product Manager & Developer  
**Timeline:** 2 Weeks (Prototype to Production)  
**Tech Stack:** TypeScript, Vercel (Serverless), Google Gemini (AI), Google Pub/Sub

## 1. The Problem: The "Creative vs. Admin" Conflict

As TRISP Studio grew, I hit a critical ceiling. I was losing 5+ hours/week to manual inquiry triage, but the real cost was the context switching.

*   **The Conflict (User Pain):** As a solo operator, I am often in deep editing flow for 4-6 hours at a time. Every "Are you free?" email forced me to stop, switch gears, and cross-reference three different documents (Calendar, Pricing PDF, Policy Doc). This fragmentation killed my creative productivity.
*   **The Business Impact:** Because I couldn't interrupt my shoots to reply instantly, my average response time lagged to ~4 hours. High-intent leads were going cold or booking competitors before I could even open my laptop.

## 2. The Prototype (And Why I Killed It)

I initially built a no-code MVP using n8n. It validated the value proposition but failed as a production product.

*   **Latency (Execution Overhead):** The workflow was "heavy." For every single inquiry, it had to connect to Google Drive, download my policy PDFs, and extract the text before it could even start thinking. This added significant friction and failure points.
*   **Fragility:** Business logic was hidden inside the proprietary JSON configurations of visual nodes. Versioning meant duplicating the entire workflow file.
*   **Cost:** Running these heavy file-processing workflows at scale would cost ~$50-70/month.

**The Pivot:** I decided to re-platform to a **Serverless TypeScript Architecture**. By hardcoding the policies into lightweight TypeScript files, I eliminated the need for file downloads, reducing execution time from minutes to milliseconds.

## 3. The Solution: Engineering Trade-offs

This section highlights the specific technical challenges I solved during the build.

### The Flow: Event-Driven Automation

    <FlowDiagram />
</div>


#### 1. Trigger: Pub/Sub Webhook
Gmail receives the email (`Photography Inquiry`). Google Pub/Sub detects the change instantly and fires a webhook to Vercel.

#### 2. Check State: Gmail API (Read)
Immediately locks the thread by labeling it `processed by TRISP AI` to prevent race conditions (Optimistic Locking).

#### 3. Extract: Gemini AI (JSON)
Sends the raw email text to Gemini AI to get clean JSON: `{ name, date, session_type }`.

#### 4. Availability: Google Calendar API
Checks Google Calendar for availability (calculating "Day Before/After" alternatives if busy).

#### 5. Draft: Gemini AI + Config Files
Drafts the response using the full configuration suite: Filtered Pricing, Policies (Deposits/Late Fees), FAQs, Brand Voice, and Sample Emails.

#### 6. Save: Gmail API (Write)
Inserts the generated text as a Draft in the original thread.

### Challenge A: The "No-Database" Architecture

*   **The Constraint:** I wanted a "stateless" architecture to avoid managing (and paying for) a PostgreSQL database just to track email status.
*   **The Solution:** I utilized **Gmail API Labels** as my state machine. The system applies a `Processed by TRISP AI` label the moment ingestion begins, flagging the thread as 'in-progress' to prevent other processes from touching it.
*   **Result:** Zero infrastructure cost for state management.

### Challenge B: Handling Race Conditions

*   **The Bug:** Pub/Sub webhooks occasionally fire twice (at-least-once delivery). During testing, this caused the AI to draft two identical replies to the same client.
*   **The Fix:** I implemented a multi-layered **Idempotency Strategy**. First, the system checks if a draft already exists. Second, it immediately "locks" the thread by applying the processed label before initiating the slow AI operations.
*   **Code Concept:** `await markEmailProcessed(msg.threadId); // Lock before AI work`

### Challenge C: Preventing AI "Hallucinations"

*   **The Risk:** Generative AI can be overly optimistic, promising dates or prices that don't exist.
*   **The Guardrails (Separation of Concerns):**
    1.  **Deterministic Logic:** I hardcoded the "Truth" (pricing, policies) into version-controlled TypeScript files. The AI cannot guess prices; it must read from the config.
    2.  **Defensive Prompting:** I engineered a system prompt with negative constraints: *"MISTAKES TO AVOID: Saying 'your vision sounds amazing' when no vision was described."*
    3.  **Fallback Math:** Instead of asking AI if I'm free, the code queries the Google Calendar API. If a slot is taken, the algorithm calculates 3 alternative slots based on availability logic.

## 4. The Result: Impact by the Numbers

## 5. Retrospective

If I were to rebuild this, I would implement **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** for the FAQ section. Currently, FAQs are a static array in the code. As the business grows, indexing past email threads to answer complex context-dependent questions (e.g., "Can I bring my dog to the studio vs. the park?") would further improve draft quality.
