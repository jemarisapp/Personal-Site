## The Problem

### The Commissioner Crisis

Running a sports league inside Discord can be chaotic. Commissioners often manage team assignments, update win/loss records, collect weekly rankings, and approve upgrades manually. This results in inconsistent data, slower operations, and admin burnout.

- **Hours Of Weekly Setup:** Commissioners spent 3 hours just creating matchup channels, plus additional time on team assignments, record keeping, and user management.
- **Commissioner Burnout:** Overwhelmed commissioners were leaving leagues within 2 seasons, causing league instability and member frustration.
- **User Engagement:** League members were only active during games, with no engagement between matchups leading to league stagnation.
- **Error Rate:** Manual data entry led to incorrect standings, delayed updates, and frustrated users questioning league integrity.

## The Strategy

Invisible automation that transforms Discord leagues from chaos to clarity

Trilo is a Discord bot that eliminates the administrative burden of running online sports leagues. By automating matchup creation, record tracking, and member management through native Discord commands, commissioners can focus on building community while players enjoy seamless, engaging league experiences. The best league management happens when nobody has to think about it.
