# Trilo: The AI Sports Commissioner

**Role:** Founder / Product Engineer | **Timeline:** Nov 2024 - Present  
**Tech Stack:** Python, OpenAI Vision API, SQLite, Discord API

---

## Overview

Trilo is an intelligent Discord bot that automates sports league administration. By handling matchup creation, record tracking, and user management through native Discord commands, it transforms chaotic manual processes into seamless experiences, allowing commissioners to focus on community building rather than spreadsheets.

## The Challenge

Running a sports league inside Discord is often chaotic and manual.
*   **Administrative Burden:** Commissioners spent 3+ hours weekly manually creating channels, updating records, and policing schedules.
*   **Burnout:** High friction led to commissioner fatigue, causing leagues to fold within two seasons.
*   **Engagement:** Without automated updates, member activity dropped significantly between games.
*   **Data Integrity:** Manual entry led to errors in standings, disputes, and reduced trust in the league.

## The Solution

I built a "invisible" automation platform that lives entirely within Discord. Trilo handles the complex logic of league operations while presenting a simple, command-based interface to users.

### Key Capabilities

*   **AI-Powered Matchup Creation:** OpenAI Vision API extracts team matchups from schedule screenshots with 95% accuracy, turning a 3-hour task into a 1-minute task.
*   **Real-Time Game Tracking:** Automated standings updates triggered by simple emoji reactions.
*   **Discord-Native Operations:** No external websites or logins required; everything happens where the community lives.
*   **Auto-Stream Announcements:** Automatically detects and posts when members go live on Twitch/YouTube.

## Technical Architecture

### AI Integration
*   **Vision API Pipeline:** Prototyped and refined prompts to extract structured data from diverse schedule screenshot formats.
*   **Natural Language Processing:** Interprets user intent for complex administrative commands.
*   **Predictive Analytics:** Provides personalized "Upgrade Assistant" recommendations for player development.

### Engineering Decisions
*   **Modular SQLite Databases:** Decoupled data stores for league structure, user stats, and subscription handling to ensure scalability.
*   **Role-Based Access Control:** Strict permissioning ensures only verified commissioners can alter league states.
*   **Rate Limiting & Caching:** Optimized interactions to stay within Discord API limits while serving real-time responses.

## Impact & Results

Trilo transformed the user journey from "Manual Chaos" to "Beautiful Efficiency."

*   **95% Reduction** in weekly administrative time (3 hours → 10 minutes).
*   **300% Increase** in user engagement due to real-time stats and automated announcements.
*   **Zero Data Entry Errors** thanks to automated schedule parsing.
*   **Retention:** Stabilized leagues that previously churned due to commissioner burnout.

## Future Roadmap

*   **Multi-Game Expansion:** extending support to basketball, baseball, and esports.
*   **Public API:** Allowing third-party tools to integrate with Trilo league data.
*   **SaaS Model:** Tiered subscription management (Free, Core, Pro) with feature gating.
