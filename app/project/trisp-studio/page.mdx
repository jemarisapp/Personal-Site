**Designing the end-to-end client experience for a creative studio.**

I designed and engineered a custom platform to own the complete client journey for my creative studio. Rather than relying on fragmented third-party tools, I built two interconnected experiences that guide clients from their first interaction to the final delivery of their assets.

<div className="not-prose my-8 flex flex-wrap justify-center gap-4 md:gap-8 text-center">
    <div className="rounded-xl bg-emerald-50 dark:bg-emerald-950/30 border border-emerald-200 dark:border-emerald-800 px-6 py-4">
        <div className="text-3xl font-bold text-emerald-600 dark:text-emerald-400">50+</div>
        <div className="text-sm text-emerald-700 dark:text-emerald-300">Clients Served</div>

## The Problem

The previous client experience was disjointed and relied on external tools that broke brand immersion.

*   **Broken Journey:** Clients would discover my work on a portfolio site but receive deliverables via generic WeTransfer links. This created two disconnected experiences.
*   **Unprofessional Delivery:** Generic file-sharing links undermined the premium perception established by the creative work itself.
*   **Selection Friction:** Asking clients to "screenshot your favorites" forced them to work around the tools rather than with them.
*   **No Brand Continuity:** Every external URL represented a moment where clients left my ecosystem.

---

## The Design Approach

I treated the client relationship as a single journey supported by two distinct applications.

### Experience 1: Discovery & Acquisition

**Hosted at [trispstudio.com](https://trispstudio.com)**

The goal was to build trust, showcase craft, and reduce the friction to inquiry.

*   **Dual-Mode Filtering:** Clients can browse by output (Photography, Brand Systems) or by methodology (Motion Design, SaaS Development). This surfaces relevant work quickly and demonstrates range without overwhelming the user.
*   **Service-Specific Landing Pages:** Each service line features dedicated pages with clear package details to remove ambiguity about offerings.
*   **Conditional Contact Form:** The intake flow adapts to the user. Photography inquiries ask about dates and locations, while design inquiries focus on timelines and budgets.

### Experience 2: Delivery & Delight

**Hosted at [clients.trispstudio.com](https://clients.trispstudio.com)**

The goal was to create a premium, branded delivery system that empowers the client.

*   **Masonry Gallery:** Images are presented in a curated layout that respects the aspect ratio of each photo rather than a generic grid.
*   **Multi-List Favorites:** Clients can create named lists (like "For Instagram" or "Print These") instead of taking screenshots. These selections are submitted directly to me through the platform.
*   **No Account Required:** Guests enter their email once to access their gallery. The system remembers them without requiring passwords or account creation.
*   **One-Click Downloads:** Clients can select photos and download them immediately as a ZIP file without navigating complex file trees.
