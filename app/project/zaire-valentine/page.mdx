## Overview

For Zaire's Valentine’s Day release, I created a short-form animation that delivered a personal, emotionally resonant message while teasing an unreleased track. The goal was to build anticipation in a way that felt organic, not promotional.

## The Vision

The final piece balanced intimacy with a cinematic tone, aligning with the holiday and reinforcing Zaire’s brand as an artist who speaks directly to his audience. The visual direction prioritized mood and atmosphere, using subtle motion to complement the unreleased audio snippet without overpowering it.

## Impact

The animation successfully helped Zaire connect with his audience on a deeper level. By giving fans an early emotional bond with his new music, the piece received strong engagement and shares across social platforms. It amplified excitement for the upcoming release while reinforcing his image as an artist who prioritizes connection with his listeners.
